# Resource Connect

Resource Connect is a web platform that helps people find social and community services
based on their needs, identity, and location.

## Problem
Many support resources exist, but they are fragmented, outdated, or difficult to find.

## Goal
Create a scalable, searchable database of verified services that can be easily filtered and found.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python (scraping, AI processing)
- PostgreSQL
- TypeScript / React (frontend)
- FastAPI or Node.js (backend)

## Project Status
Early development — planning and data ingestion phase.
